Pre-interview Exercise for Developer Candidates
The following exercise will assess your ability to deliver well structured and maintainable
code. As a TDD shop we will put equal emphasis on evaluating your tests as we will on
the code itself. The exercise should only take 30 40
minutes; don’t spend much longer
than this.
Please complete the following exercise in either Scala or Java. If this exercise goes well,
you may be asked to make further amendments to your code during a pair programming
exercise with a member of the team. Please pick the language you think you will be best
able to demonstrate your skill and experience.
Please use git to version control your exercise. After completing the first step, please
clearly tag the commit so that we can evaluate your approach. You may make other
commits to further demonstrate your approach. Please compress your answers and
submit them via your agent or send us a link to your Github (or similar) account. Do not
send us binaries, they won’t get through our firewalls.
Complete the steps in order. Don’t read ahead. At each step build the simplest
possible solution which meets our requirement. Tag a git commit after each step
so that your approach is clear.
Your answers will be used as part of our sifting and are likely to be discussed with your
interviewer at later stages.
Step 1: Shopping cart
● You are building a checkout system for a shop which only sells apples and
oranges.
● Apples cost 60p and oranges cost 25p.
● Build a checkout system which takes a list of items scanned at the till and outputs
the total cost
● For example: [ Apple, Apple, Orange, Apple ] => £2.05
● Make reasonable assumptions about the inputs to your solution; for example, many
candidates take a list of strings as input
Step 2: Simple offers
● The shop decides to introduce two new offers
○ buy one, get one free on Apples
○ 3 for the price of 2 on Oranges
● Update your checkout functions accordingly
